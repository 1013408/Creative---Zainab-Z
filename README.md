# AIM
The goal of this project is for students to create a creative response physically to Microcontroller  Systems. 
# UNIT GOALS ASSESSED
- Demonstrate an understanding of microcontrollers and interfacing electronic hardware as it relates to a Microcontroller system 
- Explore and examine the computer programming to effectively control Microcontroller systems
- Demonstrate an understanding of the Programming Design Cycle as it relates to Microcontroller Systems
# Our Project
# Section 1: Knowledge and Acquisition
A servo motor has everything built in: a motor, a feedback circuit, and most important, a motor driver. It just needs one power line, one ground, and one control pin...
# Section 2: Understanding the meaning and how you transfer that understanding
