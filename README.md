# AIM
The aim for this assignment was to create a project that projects our learning to a Microcontroller Systems. 
# UNIT GOALS ASSESSED
- Demonstrate an understanding of microcontrollers and interfacing electronic hardware as it relates to a Microcontroller system 
- Explore and examine the computer programming to effectively control Microcontroller systems
- Demonstrate an understanding of the Programming Design Cycle as it relates to Microcontroller Systems
# Our Project
For this assessment, my group and I were working to create a functioning alarm system to be added to a miniature prison replica. The system is based off of Arduino and simply consists of three individual components which is an LED light (originally a RGB LEDs), piezo buzzer and a servo motor. Each member of the group was tasked to research and successfully build a functional component, for us to collaboratively work together to bring the individual aspects together.
# Section 1: Knowledge and Acquisition
A servo motor has everything built in: a motor, a feedback circuit, and most important, a motor driver. It just needs one power line, one ground, and one control pin...
# Section 2: Understanding the meaning and how you transfer that understanding
